# -CIS195-Final-Project

1) Record a 1-3 minute video demoing your application. (Video is in the repo)
2) Answer the following reflection questions casually with (1-2 sentences) on your github's readme:
- How much do you think you learned throughout the project? List at least 2 concrete examples

Felicity: I learnt about user authentication with Firebase; Watched a tutorial to learn how. I had to implement user authentication for another project, so it was interesting to see how it works with other databases/languages/OS. I also learnt a little bit of swift UI.

Allison: Learned about SwiftUI and how to pass around state across different views. Also learned about how certain things like the AppDelegate and lifecycle translated from UIKit to SwiftUI.

- What class material do you review? List at least 2 concrete examples

Felicity: Inspiration from tableviews and also the database lecture

Allison: TableViews and database too!

- Do you plan on continuing to work on this project?

Felicity: Probably not since I don't have a mac and my VM is about to expire.
Allison: I probably will to make the core functionality work altogether. I had a bunch of views that I created but didn't manage to get working with the data.
