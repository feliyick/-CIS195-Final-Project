1) Record a 1-3 minute video demoing your application. (Video is in the repo)
2) Answer the following reflection questions casually with (1-2 sentences) on your github's readme:
- How much do you think you learned throughout the project? List at least 2 concrete examples

- What class material do you review? List at least 2 concrete examples

Felicity: Inspiration from tableviews and also the database lecture

- Do you plan on continuing to work on this project?

Felicity: Probably not since I don't have a mac and my VM is about to expire.
